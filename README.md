# r-workshop
Slides from two-day R workshop given at the Population Studies and Training Center, Brown University, August 28-29, 2018.

This is the second year of the workshop, and these slides are improvements from my 2017 materials. Those slides are available in a separate repository under my GitHub account.

Please send me an email at benjamin_bellman@brown.edu if you find these materials useful, or have any suggestions!
