What is R?
========================================================

"R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display."

"Many users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics."

What is R?
========================================================

- Very flexible

- Tons of free resources, add-ons
- Easy to write and distribute programs
- Effective for scientific transparency

How does R work?
========================================================

- Creates environment using memory on machine

- Can load different datasets as separate objects
- Install, manage, and use packages (suites of new functions and data types)
- Create and store data, results, visualizations within environment
- Export results as files, publish reports and distribute code online

How do I use R?
========================================================

- R is a world all of its own
    - Too many functions and quirks to cover in two days, or even a lifetime!
- My goal is to give you understanding of system
    - You will find own workflows/expertise with practice
- The only way to really master R is to use it independently
    - That means a lot of struggling, trial, error, and Google!
    - Documentation, guides, and user questions are everywhere
    - Some specific resources at end of these slides
    
How do I use R?
========================================================

- Can be run locally, on server, or via cloud services

- Easiest with RStudio
- Provides GUI for environment with four panels:
    1. Main I/O Console
    2. Scripts and markdown docs + data viewer
    3. Summary of environment + command history
    4. Computer files, plot viewer, package manager, help files, HTML viewer
- Let's take a look!

Plan for Workshop
========================================================

- **Tues. Morning:** 
    - Introduction to R, Data Manipulation (```tidyverse``` and ```dplyr```)
- **Tues. Afternoon:** 
    - Data Visualization (```ggplot2```), Practice
- **Wed. Morning:** 
    - Cleaning Data, Advanced Topics
- **Wed. Afternoon:** 
    - Practice

Basics: Anatomy of a command
========================================================
```obj <- funct(arg1, arg2 = True, arg3 = "setting", ...)```
- ```obj``` = object where output of ```function``` is stored
    - ```<-``` is the assignment operator for storing results
- ```funct``` = name of function being called
- ```arg1``` = first argument is usually object/data being operated on
- ```arg2, arg3``` = additional arguments that change how ```funct``` works
    - Can refer to true/false value, different methods, etc.
    - Have default values, so not always necessary to use them

Basics: Objects and Data
========================================================

- There are a few basic types of objects/data
    - Single values
    - Vectors (integer/numeric, character, factor)
    - Matrices
    - Data frames
    - Lists
    
- Other types of data are introduced through packages
  - Built on these basic data structures

Basics: Objects and Data
========================================================
class: small-code
- We'll start by using the console as a calculator

- Results of commands are returned there

```{r}
2 + 3
```

Basics: Objects and Data
========================================================
class: small-code
- Results can be stored as objects (AKA variables)
```{r}
a <- 2 + 3
a
```
- Character strings can also be stored as data
```{r}
string <- "Hello world"
string
```

Data: Vectors
========================================================
class: small-code
- Vectors hold multiple elements of the same type, can be used for element-wise operations
```{r}
x <- c(2, 18, 12, 23, 73)
x - 3
str(x)
```

Data: Vectors
========================================================
class: small-code
- The ```c``` function "c"oerces elements into a vector
- The ```str``` function lets us see the "str"ucture of the data
- Vectors can also contain character strings and logical values (important for indexing)
```{r}
c("Learning", "R", "is", "fun!")
c(T, F, F, F, T, F)
```

Data: Vectors
========================================================
class: small-code
- You can reference cells of vectors using ```[n]``` function/notation
    - ```n``` is number or vector of numbers

```{r}
x <- c("Learning", "R", "is", "fun!")
x[1]
x[c(1, 4)]
```

Data: Vectors
========================================================
class: small-code
- The index can also be a vector of logical values
    - Later, we'll use conditional statements

```{r}
index <- c(T, F, F, T)
x[index]
```


Data: Vectors
========================================================
class: small-code
- Element-wise operations on vectors work for all kinds of data
```{r}
v <- c("abcd", "efgh", "ijkl")
v
substr(v, 1, 2)
```

Data: Factors
========================================================
class: small-code
- However, R can't give meaning to character strings on its own
```{r}
summary(c("Red", "Blue", "Red", "Blue"))
```
- We can create a factor, which creates values according to category
```{r}
summary(factor(c("Red", "Blue", "Red", "Blue")))
```

Data: Factors
========================================================
class: small-code
- Creating a factor is similar to using labels for categories in STATA
- R can also order the levels in factors
```{r}
temperatures <- c("High", "Low", "High","Low", "Medium")
temp_factor <- factor(temperatures, 
                      order = TRUE, 
                      levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))
temp_factor
```

Data: Matrices
========================================================
class: small-code
- Matrices are like two-dimensional vectors
    - Can only hold one type of data
```{r}
matrix(1:9, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)
```
- Note that ```1:9``` generates a vector of all integers from 1 through 9

Data: Matrices
========================================================
class: small-code
- You can create matrices from vectors
```{r}
col1 <- c(11, 22, 33)
col2 <- c(44, 55, 66)
col3 <- c(77, 88, 99)
matrix(c(col1, col2, col3), ncol = 3)
```

Data: Matrices
========================================================
class: small-code
- Refer to cells using ```[ ]``` and two dimensions
    - First term for rows, second term for columns
    
```{r}
m <- matrix(c(col1, col2, col3), ncol = 3)
m
m[2, 2]
```


Data: Data frames
========================================================
class: small-code
- In my view, matrices are best used for math calculations
- Restrictive in usage, hard to create and manipulate
- You will most likely be using data frames in R
```{r}
data.frame(col1, col2, col3)
```

Data: Data frames
========================================================
class: small-code
- Data frames store a variety of data types in columns of the same table
    - Like a standard dataset in STATA
    - However, you can load as many data frames as you want!!!
```{r}
col2 <- c("lmao", "brb", "smh")            #character
col3 <- factor(c("Good", "Good", "Bad"))   #factor
col4 <- c(T, F, T)                         #logical
df <- data.frame(col1, col2, col3, col4, 
                 stringsAsFactors = F)
```
- Note: R changes character data to factors by default when creating data frames

Data: Data frames
========================================================
class: small-code
```{r}
df
summary(df)
```

Data: Data frames
========================================================
class: small-code
- You can reference data frames like matrices with ```[ ]```
- Reference and add columns by name with ```$```

```{r}
df$new <- 0
df$new
df
```

Data: Data frames
========================================================
class: small-code
- You can load data from a range of file types with built-in functions
- We'll look at packages that cover even more

```{r}
#change to own file path
salaries <- read.csv("~/Google Drive/Computer Backup/R Workshop/Data/white-house-salaries.csv")
summary(salaries)
```

Data: Lists
========================================================
class: small-code
- Similar to a vector, but can contain multiple data types in on object, even other lists
- Not critical for beginners, but new object types from packages are often built on lists

```{r}
l <- list(a, v, matrix(1:9, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3), salaries)
summary(l)
```

Data: Lists
========================================================
class: small-code
- Reference list elements with double brackets ```[[ ]]```
```{r}
l[[2]]
```
- Add ```[ ]``` to reference cells of object in list
```{r}
l[[3]][2, 2]
```

Basics: Functions
========================================================

- When coding, think of objects as nouns and functions as verbs

- R is a "functional language"
    - Can be directy referenced as objects and inputs without storing in memory
    - Packages are suites of functions
    - Can write own functions (we'll discuss later!)

- Must pay attention to required arguments of functions

- Can always view CRAN documentation of function with ```?function```

Functions: Math operations
========================================================

- Some numeric operations:

Operation | Syntax
------------- | -------------
Addition | ```a + b```
Subtraction | ```a - b```
Negative | ```-a```
Multiplication | ```a * b```
Division | ```a / b```
Exponents | ```a ^ b```
Square root | ```sqrt(a)```
Natrual and common logs | ```log(a)```, ```log10(a)```

Functions: Math operations
========================================================

- Some vector/matrix operations:

Operation | Syntax
------------- | -------------
Sum | ```sum(a)```
Matrix multiplication | ```a %*% b```
Mean | ```mean(a)```
Standard deviation | ```sd(a)```
Quantiles | ```quantile(a)```
Min or Max | ```min(a)```, ```max(a)```
Rescale or Recenter | ```scale(a)```

Functions: Strings
========================================================

- Some character string functions:

Operation | Syntax
------------- | -------------
Extract substring | ```substr(a, start = 1, stop = n)```
Splitting | ```strsplit(a, split = "")```
Combining text | ```paste(a, ..., sep = "")```
Convert all cases | ```toupper(a)```, ```tolower(a)```

Functions: And beyond
========================================================

- There's a huge range of built-in functions and utilities

- We will discuss more after break
- However, I can't possibly cover them all
    - (Not to mention all the packages out there)
- So if you're wondering: "Is there a function for..."
    - The answer is probably yes!

Some resources
========================================================

- Important resources distributed through CRAN infrastructure
    - Documentation and vignettes by package authors
- Past questions on StackExchange and sub-forums
- Lots of resources at https://rdrr.io/
